# Multiple Files Example

This example demonstrates creating multiple local files using the module and additional resources.

It creates:
- A main file through the module
- A configuration file with environment variables
- A secrets file with sensitive data

## Usage

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This will create three files with configurable suffixes in the example directory.
